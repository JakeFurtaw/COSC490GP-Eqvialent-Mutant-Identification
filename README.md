#Description of Project:

Automatic Equivalent Mutant Identification using An Abtract Syntax Tree based Nueral Network Model.
For this project we are using python to create a Neural Network that will traverse our code and sort out which mutants are equivalent and which arent automatically. We will use a ASTNN to do the sorting and identification. After the model is written we will split the dataset 80% for training and 20% for testing.
