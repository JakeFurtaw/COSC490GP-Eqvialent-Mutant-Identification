# Automatic Equivalent Mutant Identification
We will be using creating an AST based neural network model that will automatically detect equivalent mutants in a dataset.
The program and model will have the following functionality:
- Convert dataset into ASTs
- Sort which mutants are equivalent or not
- Feed dataset to be trained by the neural network
- Provide analysis to detemine success of the model

**Dataset used** : https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/fd8e674385214fe9a327941525c31f53
