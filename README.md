# Automatic Equivalent Mutant Identification
We will be creating an AST based neural network model that will automatically detect equivalent mutants in a dataset.
The program and model will have the following functionality:
- Process dataset to sort java and c programs
- Parse dataset with java and c parsers
- Feed parsed data into neural network to train it
- Use remaining data to test the neural network
- Compute data results using numpy 
- Provide analysis to detemine success of the model

**Dataset used** : https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/fd8e674385214fe9a327941525c31f53
