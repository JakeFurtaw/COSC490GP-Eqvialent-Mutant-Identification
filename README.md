# Automatic Equivalent Mutant Identification
We will be creating an AST based neural network model that will automatically detect equivalent mutants in a dataset.
The program and model will have the following functionality:
- âœ“ Process dataset to sort java and c programs
- Parse dataset with java parser to prepare it for the AST
- Feed 70%-80% parsed data into ASTNN to train it on the dataset
- Use remaining data to test the ASTNN after training is complete
- Compute Accuracy, F1 Score, and other necessary data results using numpy
- Provide analysis to detemine success of the model
